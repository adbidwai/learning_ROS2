# ROS2 Bash suite
Rosbash suite commands in ROS2 are different from ROS1 in the following way : </br>
1) 'rosrun' is replaced by 'ros2 run', 'rostopic' is replaced by 'ros2 topic' and so on

# Build System
ROS2 uses ```colcon``` as the tool for buiding packages inside workspaces analogous to ROS1's ```catkin```
